# Work-Day-Scheduler

## WHY
 This was a wonderful opportunity to implement my knowledge of JavaScript, Bootstrap, Jquery and utilizing third party APIS and CDN's to create
 a fully functioning useful application for employees.
 
## WHAT I DID 
I created a responsive web design for daily work planner that allows users to clearly layout their workday to do items.
Upon loading, the planner displays the current date and color coded time-blocks for the typical 9-5 workday.

Each time block has a text area, the user can click into and type to do items, notes, reminders whatever they wish.
If the time block has passed for the day, the color of the block will be GREYED OUT and I added a FEATURE where  the user can no longer click and edit
that textblock. The users text if any will be crossed out as well.
If the time block is in the PRESENT, the color of the block will be YELLOW and the user can continue to edit that time block.
If the timeblock is in the FUTURE, the color of the block will be SALMON and the user can also still edit those tasks. 

Upon refreshing or , opening of the application the user will still see all of the previous content of that day.
The text will persist. 

## WHAT I LEARNED
 My logic skills and coding are improving and I am thoroughly enjoying completing a nice clean code that results in an application that is, not only
 visually pleasing with a  responsive web design, but also FUNCTIONS WELL and
 has NO ERROR MESSAGES in the console, and is EASY TO USE !I take great pride in the functionality of an application!

## DEMO
 ** Below is a short demo of the planner, the user is typing into current and future time blocks. The user then saves the items. When the user refreshes 
 the page, the time has changed.
Thus the planner has updated reflecting which hour is NOW CURRENT, PAST or FUTURE. Note the past time blocks have a line through them and CANNOT BE clicked
into or edited anymore for the day.
